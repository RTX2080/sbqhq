blank fans for qhq

## macOS

first you should enter your work space.

then run ``sh qaq.sh`` to test if your terminal can load *.jpg or *.png.

if there are errors about ``imgcat``, then you should run ``brew install iterm2``&``brew install eddieantonio/eddieantonio/imgcat``,and run ``sh qaq.sh``in your itrem.

if you want to use this forever , just modify your ``~/.zshrc``or ``~/.bash_profile``, and add ``export PATH=yourPATH:$PATH ``, then add ``alias yourname='sh qaq.sh'``after this. Then you can run ``yourname``in terminal to show these nauseated things about qhq.
